# React Google News
A simple [React](https://reactjs.org/) front end using the [Google News API](https://newsapi.org/).

Implements Bootstrap via [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/).
Makes API calls with [fetch](https://github.com/github/fetch).

Configured with [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).

Express back end to make API requests and protect API key. Configure API key locally with dotenv. For production, set environment variable manually (through command line).

Commands:
```
npm run webpack-build
npm run webpack-start
npm run start
npm run dev
```

Use `npm run dev` to run Webpack and Node Express server.
